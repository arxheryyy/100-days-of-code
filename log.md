# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 15 August 2020 

Progress:I have started coding a new website with 4 pages outside of index.html all with a nav bar that links back to each other and also filled it with the relevant content. I have also started on the CSS styling of the nav bar.

Thoughts:I have done this before but this time im being more systematic and orderly with my code.

### Day 2 16 August 2020

Progress:I have worked on some small parts of the CSS styling but could not figure out how to get my logo to be on the nav bar and also could'nt figure out why the hover is only covering the words on the nav bar. I also added logos to the social media page, and changed up how the a tags look on that page.

Thoughts:Overall pretty frustrated but hopefully I will do better tomorrow
