# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 15 August 2020 

Progress:I have started coding a new website with 4 pages outside of index.html all with a nav bar that links back to each other and also filled it with the relevant content. I have also started on the CSS styling of the nav bar.

Thoughts:I have done this before but this time im being more systematic and orderly with my code.

### Day 2 16 August 2020

Progress:I have worked on some small parts of the CSS styling but could not figure out how to get my logo to be on the nav bar and also could'nt figure out why the hover is only covering the words on the nav bar. I also added logos to the social media page, and changed up how the a tags look on that page.

Thoughts:Overall pretty frustrated but hopefully I will do better tomorrow

### Day 3 17 August 2020

Progress:I have finished up all the things i wanted to do yesterday fixed alot off the problems but cant figure out how to use background-image in CSS and also still cant figure out how to get the hover to work on the nav bar 

Thoughts:Feeling pretty good about this website cant really find anything else to add to it. Happy that i fixed alot of the problems that i ran into yesterday.

### Day 4 18 August 2020

Progress: I'm tring to re-write my IT Sales System terminal application that i did as a final prject for my Java module in Python to learn Python's syntax a little better as i want to dive into python machine learning soon, so i thought learning the fundamentals of python by re-creating this project will help me learn the ins and outs to python. I did alot of reading for the syntax of object and class oriented programming in python but it is still a little bit wierd to me as there are alot of unexpected errors in VS Code, when coding in python.

Thoughts: Excited to learn Python maybe make a few games before diving into machine learning as it seems pretty intense.

### Day 5 19 August 2020
Progress: I completed the main functonality of the program just not done implementing some of the restrictions for the computer IDs. I haven't added the restriction whereby it check to make sure that the Computer ID has 3 digits behind the starting letter, also I am abit interested to make this into a web application but ill see where this goes.

Thoughts: Very happy that i got the hang of OOP in python although some of the funtions that I'm used to in Java is not around there are many work arounds that i found for python

### Day 6 20 August 2020
Progress: I figured out how to have multiple conditions for if statements and also change the checking of the IDs to be a function instead so that the code looks cleaner currently researching on how to check the IDs in the array so that there will be not matching IDs 

Thoughts: Pretty happy that i can get python even though the syntax is very strange to me as it doesnt have -> {} these and everything depends on indentation i would still rather -> {} these as im more used to it and it is easier to read

### Day 7 21 August 2020
progress: I started using tkinter as a GUI frame work to make this terminal application into a GUI application and also sorted out all the problems with the checking of Computer IDs

Thoughts: Excited to try out this GUI framework to learn how to create GUI python applications

### Day 8 22 August 2020
Progress: I am done with the first command with is to loop through an object array and print out the attributes in GUI which was pretty tricky but i got it done also i did the quit button but that was simple. tkinter is very tricky to work with but i think i can get through it

Thoughts: a little frustrated as it took so long just to figure out a simple feature as the syntax is janky and the official website shows the wrong syntax so i had to rely on stack overflow.

### Day 9 23 August 2020
Progress: I am super happy with the progress today even though it took me 30-45 minutes to figure out how to get user input using tkinter's entry function i finally got it functioning. I was on the brink on giving up but thank God I pushed through as any programmer or developer would know when you finally get something to work the sense of satisfaction is like you're in cloud 9.

Thoughts: Super happy with what i did today even though it was very frustrating at the start, when i figured it out i felt a lift in my spirits as i hit the run button and see that its working, i need to work on the styling and also impliment the Computer ID checking into the GUI version of this application.

### Day 10 24 August 2020
Progress: Finished up the bits and pieces of the GUI and it is fully functional now but it isnt very pretty got all the ID checking in place and I added an error messsage that shows up if the computer ID doesn't match the requirements

Thoughts: Happy that I have finally finished this project, but kind of lost for what to do next. I will find another project to work on next but thanks to this challenge I finally finished something I wanted to do as usually once I run into an error that I can't wrap my head around I would usually find something else to do and forget about the porject.

### Day 11 25 August 2020
progrss : Started on a new project that will help me keep my downloads folder organised by the date that it was created, Figured out how to get all the files from a directory and put it into a list/array but i can't figure out how to get the time that it was created.

Thoughts: Excited for this new project it is actually useful to me this time and can't wait for a clutter free downloads folder

### Day 12 26 August 2020
progress : I have figured out how to get the dates that the files are created and the paths of the files but I cannot find out how to check if theres a file that matches the month and year then move it into the folder

Thoughts: having fun solving this problem cant wait till I can actually finish this project.

### Day 13 27 August 2020
Progress: I have made all the individual files into datetime objects so that i can get the month that it was created but the if condition keeps returning false although it is pretty much 8 == 8 still cant figure that out.

Thoughts: a little frustrated at this but i can't wait to finish this project
