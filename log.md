# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 15 August 2020 

Progress:I have started coding a new website with 4 pages outside of index.html all with a nav bar that links back to each other and also filled it with the relevant content. I have also started on the CSS styling of the nav bar.

Thoughts:I have done this before but this time im being more systematic and orderly with my code.

### Day 2 16 August 2020

Progress:I have worked on some small parts of the CSS styling but could not figure out how to get my logo to be on the nav bar and also could'nt figure out why the hover is only covering the words on the nav bar. I also added logos to the social media page, and changed up how the a tags look on that page.

Thoughts:Overall pretty frustrated but hopefully I will do better tomorrow

### Day 3 17 August 2020

Progress:I have finished up all the things i wanted to do yesterday fixed alot off the problems but cant figure out how to use background-image in CSS and also still cant figure out how to get the hover to work on the nav bar 

Thoughts:Feeling pretty good about this website cant really find anything else to add to it. Happy that i fixed alot of the problems that i ran into yesterday.

### Day 4 18 August 2020

Progress: I'm tring to re-write my IT Sales System terminal application that i did as a final prject for my Java module in Python to learn Python's syntax a little better as i want to dive into python machine learning soon, so i thought learning the fundamentals of python by re-creating this project will help me learn the ins and outs to python. I did alot of reading for the syntax of object and class oriented programming in python but it is still a little bit wierd to me as there are alot of unexpected errors in VS Code, when coding in python.

Thoughts: Excited to learn Python maybe make a few games before diving into machine learning as it seems pretty intense.
