### Day 0 15 August 2020 

Progress:I have started coding a new website with 4 pages outside of index.html all with a nav bar that links back to each other and also filled it with the relevant content. I have also started on the CSS styling of the nav bar.

thoughts:I have done this before but this time im being more systematic and orderly with my code.
